# openEyeTrack

## Statement of Need
When faced with a decision, an organism uses information gathered by its senses in order to determine the best course of action. Vision is one of the primary senses and tracking eye gaze can offer insight into the cues that affect decision making behavior. Thus, to study decision-making and other cognitive processes it is fundamentally necessary to accurately track eye position. However, commercial eye trackers are 1) often very expensive, and 2) incorporate their own proprietary software to detect the movement of the eye. Closed source solutions also limit the researcher’s ability to be fully informed regarding the ongoing processes within their experiment and incorporate modifications tailored to their needs. Here, we present our software solution, openEyeTrack, a low cost, high speed, low latency, open-source video-based eye tracker [@openEyeTrack]. Video based eye trackers can perform nearly as well as classical scleral search coil based methods and can be used for most applications [@10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00049].

## Software and Hardware components
openEyeTrack is a video based eye tracker that takes advantage of OpenCV [@opencv_library], a low cost high speed infrared camera and Gige-V APIs for Linux provided by Teledyne DALSA [@GigeV], the graphical user interface toolkit QT5 [@qt5] and the opencv based gui elements [@cvui], all of which can be downloaded for free. The only costs are from the hardware components such as the camera (Genie Nano M640 NIR, Teledyne DALSA, ~$450, ~730 frames per second) and infrared light source, an articulated arm to position the camera (Manfrotto: $130), a computer with one or more gigabit network interface cards, and a power over ethernet switch to power and receive data from the camera.

By using the Gige-V Framework to capture the frames from the DALSA camera and the OpenCV simple blob detector, openEyeTrack is able to accurately calculate the position and area of the pupil. We include pupil size calculations because of its putative link to arousal levels and emotions of the observer.


## Tested Hardware Specs
- Computer: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5820K CPU @ 3.30GHz, 64GB
 - Basic IR light source
     - We use this one from Amazon [IR illuminator](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q86153D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
 - Camera: [Teledyne DALSA Genie Nano M640 NIR](https://www.teledynedalsa.com/en/products/imaging/cameras/genie-nano-1gige/)
 - Netgear Power-Over-Ethernet Switch

## Software Specs
- Ubuntu 16.04
- OpenCV 4.1.0
- Qt 5.5.1
- [GigE-V Framework for Linux](https://www.teledynedalsa.com/en/products/imaging/vision-software/linux-gige-v-framework/)
- Git
- [cvui framework](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui)

We have had problems with 18.04 and recommend an install on the 16.04 system. We do not support Windows at the moment.  

## Installation

 - Install git by typing: $ sudo apt-get install git-core
 - Clone repository by typing: $ git clone https://github.com/mailchand/openEyeTrack.git
 - After installing the GigE-V Framework, you can either manually set up Qt and OpenCV or run the installation script denoted as *softwareInstall* within the repository
   - If you choose to run the installation script you may need to first convert it to an executable by typing: $ chmod +x softwareInstall.sh
   - Occassionally, you may be prompted to press "y" to continue the installation process
   - Please explicitly run the last two commands at the bottom of this file concerning linking of libraries and make sure Ubuntu actually identifies where your libraries are.

### Installing GigE-V Framework
- Go to Teledyne dalsa website and download the GigE-V Framework for Linux under support → downloads → SDKs
- Install all prerequisites listed in User Manual (GNU make can be installed through build-essential and libX11-dev should be libx11-dev)
- Unpack the .tar file in downloads and then go inside the newly created directory and copy the .tar file that looks like GigE-V-Framework_**x86**_2.02.0.0132.tar.gz to $HOME
- Cd into home and unpack tar file (use tar -zxf)
- Cd into DALSA and type $ ./corinstall
- Go to connection settings and edit the ethernet connection that is associated with the camera
- Go to the IPv4 settings and change the method to “Link-Local Only” and save changes
- Make sure the connection is enabled and verify you can connect to camera by going to terminal and typing:$ GigeDeviceStatus 
- Try running the genicam_cpp_demo found under DALSA/GigeV/examples
  - Running the demo 
- ***run the gev_nettweak tool (found under GigeV/bin) to enhance performance and prevent resetting the image transfer.***
This tool needs to be re-run if the system restarts

### Installing Qt 5.5.1
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install qt5-default

### Installing opencv (version 4.1.0)
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository

    sudo apt -y install libgoogle-glog-dev libgflags-dev
    sudo apt -y install libgphoto2-dev libeigen3-dev libhdf5-dev doxygen

Clone opencv and opencv_contrib

    git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
    cd opencv
    git checkout 4.1.0
    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
    cd opencv_contrib
    git checkout 4.1.0
    cd ..

 (Need to clone the same version of opencv_contrib)
 
 Make a build directory within opencv and start compilation process
 
    cd opencv
    mkdir build
    cd build
    
 Use:
 ```
 cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local 
 -D WITH_TBB=ON 
 -D WITH_V4L=ON 
 -D WITH_QT=ON 
 -D WITH_OPENGL=ON 
 -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules 
 -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF 
 -D OPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON ..
```
(For later versions of OpenCV, need to include OPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON)

Use:  

    sudo make install -j4
(having the ‘-j4’ says to use use multiple threads which greatly speeds up this step)

**Then type:**

    sudo sh -c 'echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf'
    sudo ldconfig
