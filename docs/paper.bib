abstract = "Background
Video-based noninvasive eye trackers are an extremely useful tool for many areas of research. Many open-source eye trackers are available but current open-source systems are not designed to track eye movements with the temporal resolution required to investigate the mechanisms of oculomotor behavior. Commercial systems are available but employ closed source hardware and software and are relatively expensive, limiting wide-spread use.
New method
Here we present Oculomatic, an open-source software and modular hardware solution to eye tracking for use in humans and non-human primates.
Results
Oculomatic features high temporal resolution (up to 600Hz), real-time eye tracking with high spatial accuracy (<0.5°), and low system latency (∼1.8ms, 0.32ms STD) at a relatively low-cost.
Comparison with existing method(s)
Oculomatic compares favorably to our existing scleral search-coil system while being fully non invasive.
Conclusions
We propose that Oculomatic can support a wide range of research into the properties and neural mechanisms of oculomotor behavior."
